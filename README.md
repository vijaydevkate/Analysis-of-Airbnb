# Commercial-Analysis-of-Airbnb-Financial-Model
## Introduction
* Airbnb hosts are increasingly utilizing their property portfolios as permanent holiday rentals, effectively treating them as businesses. This trend is contributing to a high number of commercial properties.

* The aim of our project is to develop an interactive visualization tool that showcases essential commercial aspects and statistics of Airbnb listings across the United States. The tool will be designed for a broad audience and provide a hands-on experience that highlights key insights into the current state of Airbnb rentals.

* The objective is to showcase the characteristics of Airbnb rentals and provide insights into the distinction between "home sharing" and commercial use. A range of metrics, including the percentage of entire home rentals, host portfolios, number of licensed listings, and other relevant data points, will be utilized to achieve this.
## Methodology
The plan is to create self-explanatory visuals that can be interacted with using basic dropdowns, filters, and searches. The initial dashboards focused on USA data, with scalability to add any other country in place. During later stages, the tool was expanded to incorporate Italy's data as well.

The resultant Tableau tool lets the users:

  * View listings based on key commercial metrics.
  * Scan through various geographical levels, including country, state, county, city/town, zip, etc., to see location-wise metrics such as the number of listings, revenue generated, and host information.
  * Analyze rental frequency information to gain insight into the type of listing, whether it is commercial, semi-commercial, or home-sharing.
  * Understand the differences between short-term and long-term rentals based on the number of nights stayed.
